## Current Phase
- Completed Figma-aligned UI updates for Sign Up and Log In (in Development / version-test)
- Implemented and tested basic login + signup workflows to match the updated UI
- Preparing evidence (screenshots) + documenting final UI/workflow decisions in GitHub
- Starting implementation of username → slug behavior on account creation (validation + setting slug)

## Semester Goals

### 1) UI Update (Auth Pages)
- Update Sign In / Sign Up pages in Bubble to match the Figma designs

### 2) Username → Slug Routing
- On account creation, set the user’s handle/username to become the **User slug**
- Preserve existing MVP paths using `/s/` and `/p/` for redirects
