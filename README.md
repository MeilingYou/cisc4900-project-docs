## Current Phase:
-Learn Bubble basics + understand the existing app structure

## Initial Goal
- Update the Sign In / Sign Up pages in Bubble to match the Figma designs.
- On account creation, set the user’s **username** to also become the **slug** for their account URL.
- For users who already have accounts in the MVP version: their existing **custom slug** will be treated as their **username**.
