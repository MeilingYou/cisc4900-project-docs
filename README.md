## Current Phase
- Review existing Bubble app structure (pages, workflows, data types)
- Document current vs. Figma gaps for Sign In / Sign Up
- Set up v2 pages for safe iteration (`sign-in_v2`, `sign-up_v2`)

## Semester Goals

### 1) UI Update (Auth Pages)
- Update Sign In / Sign Up pages in Bubble to match the Figma designs

### 2) Username → Slug Routing
- On account creation, set the user’s handle/username to become the **User slug**
- Preserve existing MVP paths using `/s/` and `/p/` for redirects
