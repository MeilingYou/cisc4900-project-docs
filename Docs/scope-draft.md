What I’m learning:
-Bubble editor layout (Design / Workflow / Data / Styles)
-How pages + reusable elements are structured
-How navigation and URL routes work in this app

Possible improvements (not final yet)
-Clean up Sign in / Sign up UI
-Fix layout spacing
-Update page navigation / URL path consistency
